# SII Framework: Advanced AI-Robotics Integration with Self-Healing

Welcome to the **System Interface Integration (SII) Framework**— advanced software and platform that seamlessly integrates **AI, robotics control, and self-healing systems**. This framework provides a strong foundation for building intelligent robots that can autonomously debug, optimize, and secure themselves using **quantum-ready encryption**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Shared Memory Communication Bus**: Real-time data flow between AI and robotic subsystems.
- **Self-Healing Monitoring System**: Detects performance issues and autonomously repairs them.
- **AI-Driven Motor Control**: Real-time decision-making integrated with hardware.
- **End-to-End AES-256 Encryption**: Secure communication resistant to quantum attacks.
- **Modular, Scalable Design**: Easy to extend with vision, sensors, or additional modules.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd SII-framework
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome
   ```

3. **Run the System:**

   To launch all modules in parallel:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Run Tests:**

   Verify the shared memory and encryption functionalities:

   ```bash
   python test_shared_memory.py
   python test_encryption.py
   ```

## 🛡️ Security

The framework includes **AES-256 encryption** to secure communication between subsystems. In future releases, we will add **post-quantum cryptography algorithms** for enhanced security.

## 🔮 Roadmap

- **Vision System Integration**: Use OpenCV and YOLO for object detection and perception.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Implement algorithms like Kyber for enhanced security.
- **Hardware Testing**: Deploy the framework on Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano for real-world testing.

## 💡 Future Work

- Expand the self-healing system with **predictive maintenance algorithms**.
- Implement **ROS 2 integration** for large-scale robotics control.
- Optimize the framework with **low-level C++ bindings** for real-time performance.
